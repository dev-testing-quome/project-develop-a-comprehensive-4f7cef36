# Developer Setup Guide - project-develop-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on the "project-develop-a-comprehensive" real estate platform.  We'll focus on a modular architecture, separating the frontend (likely React or similar), backend (likely Python/Django or similar), and database (likely PostgreSQL or similar).

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * **Python:** 3.9 or higher (for backend - adjust as needed based on framework choice)
    * **Node.js:** 16 or higher (for frontend)
    * **PostgreSQL:** 13 or higher (or your chosen database)
    * **Docker:** 20.10.0 or higher (recommended for Option 1)
    * **Docker Compose:** 1.29.0 or higher (recommended for Option 1)

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git
    * Text editor or IDE (see recommendations below)

* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Highly recommended for both frontend and backend development.  Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, and your chosen database.
    * **PyCharm (for backend):** A robust IDE specifically for Python development.
    * **WebStorm (for frontend):** A powerful IDE for JavaScript and frontend development.


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

This option simplifies setup by containerizing the entire application.

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-develop-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup Commands:**
   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

3. **Development docker-compose configuration:**  A `docker-compose.yml` file (example):

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     web:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"  # Frontend port
       depends_on:
         - backend
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000" # Backend port
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/database_name
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
         - POSTGRES_DB=database_name
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  Configure hot reloading for both frontend and backend.  For the frontend (assuming React), tools like `nodemon` or built-in features of your build tool (Webpack, Parcel) can be used. For the backend (assuming Django), consider using a development server with automatic reloading.


### Option 2: Native Development

This option requires installing dependencies directly on your system.

1. **Backend Setup (Python virtual environment, dependencies):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming you have a requirements.txt file
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup (Node.js, npm packages):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup (local database configuration):**
   Install PostgreSQL and create a database.  Configure the database connection details in your application's configuration files.


## Environment Configuration

1. **Required Environment Variables:**  Examples include:
   * `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your database.
   * `SECRET_KEY`:  A secret key for security.
   * `API_KEYS`:  For external services (MLS integration, etc.).
   * `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, etc.: For email communication.

2. **Local Development .env file setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or appropriate project directory) and populate it with your local environment variables.  Example:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database_name
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DEBUG=True
   ```

3. **Configuration for different environments:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) to manage settings for different environments (development, staging, production).


## Running the Application

1. **Start commands for development:**
   * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
   * **Native:**  Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver` for Django) and the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start` for React).

2. **How to access frontend and backend:**  The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` (adjust ports as needed).

3. **API documentation access:**  Use tools like Swagger or Postman to access and test the API.


## Development Workflow

1. **Git workflow and branching strategy:** Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).

2. **Code formatting and linting setup:**  Use linters like `flake8` (Python) and `ESLint` (JavaScript) to enforce consistent code style.  Configure your IDE to automatically format code.

3. **Testing procedures:** Write unit tests and integration tests.  Use a testing framework like `pytest` (Python) and `Jest` (JavaScript).

4. **Debugging setup:** Use your IDE's debugging tools or a debugger like `pdb` (Python) to debug your code.


## Database Management

1. **Running migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Django migrations, Alembic) to manage database schema changes.

2. **Seeding development data:** Create scripts to populate the database with sample data for development purposes.

3. **Database reset procedures:**  Develop scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

1. **Running unit tests:** Execute your unit tests using the appropriate testing framework (e.g., `pytest`, `Jest`).

2. **Running integration tests:** Execute your integration tests, which test the interaction between different parts of the application.

3. **Test coverage reports:** Generate test coverage reports to track the percentage of code covered by tests.


## Common Development Tasks

1. **Adding new API endpoints:**  Follow the established API design and implement new endpoints in the backend.

2. **Adding new frontend components:**  Develop new components using your chosen frontend framework (e.g., React).

3. **Database schema changes:**  Make changes to the database schema using migrations and update the application code accordingly.

4. **Adding dependencies:**  Add new dependencies using `pip` (Python) and `npm` (JavaScript).


## Troubleshooting

1. **Common setup issues:** Check the logs for errors, ensure dependencies are installed correctly, and verify environment variables.

2. **Port conflicts resolution:**  Change ports if there are conflicts.

3. **Dependency issues:**  Resolve dependency conflicts by carefully examining your `requirements.txt` and `package.json` files.

4. **Environment variable problems:**  Double-check your `.env` file and make sure environment variables are properly set.


## Contributing

1. **Code style guidelines:** Adhere to the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).

2. **Pull request process:**  Create pull requests for code changes, ensure they are reviewed, and address any feedback before merging.

3. **Issue reporting:**  Report issues using the project's issue tracker, providing clear descriptions and steps to reproduce.


This guide provides a foundational setup.  Specific commands and configurations might need adjustments based on the chosen technologies and project structure. Remember to consult the documentation for your chosen frameworks and libraries for more detailed information.
