## Installation

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-develop-a-comprehensive

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Start the application
# Backend (from backend directory)
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend (from frontend directory)
npm run dev
```

### Docker Setup

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run: `docker-compose up --build`

This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.
